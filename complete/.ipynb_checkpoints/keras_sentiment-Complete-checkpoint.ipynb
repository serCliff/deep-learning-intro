    "### The Embedding layer\n",
    "A word embedding is a class of approaches for representing words and documents using a dense vector representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an improvement over more the traditional bag-of-word model encoding schemes where large sparse vectors were used to represent each word or to score each word within a vector to represent an entire vocabulary. These representations were sparse because the vocabularies were vast and a given word or document would be represented by a large vector comprised mostly of zero values. Instead, in an embedding, words are represented by dense vectors where a vector represents the projection of the word into a continuous vector space. The position of a word within the vector space is learned from text and is based on the words that surround the word when it is used. The position of a word in the learned vector space is referred to as its embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word embedding can be learned as part of a deep learning model. This can be a slower approach, but tailors the model to a specific training dataset."
